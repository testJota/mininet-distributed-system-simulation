# Mininet Distributed System Simulation
In this project we use Mininet to simulate and evaluate distributed systems protocols, using broadcast protocols avaible at https://github.com/interestIngc/stochastic-checking-simulation.

The simulation is adapted to run in a Mininet virtual machine (http://mininet.org/download/).

### Usage

* Clone this directory into a Mininet VM.
* Create a folder for the output files (mkdir outputs).
* Run launch.py as superuser.

### Parameters

All the simulation parameters concerning network topology are available in ConfigFiles/simulation_conf.json.

Protocol parameters can be found at ConfigFiles/input.json.
